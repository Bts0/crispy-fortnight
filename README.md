Custom Python 2.7 RAT built just for fun. The intent is to understand the "inner-workings" of RAT's and improve detection of malicious behavior. Features are added for purely educational learning, NOT for malicious activity! You are responsible for your own actions. 

# How to run the things
Run server.py(implant) and client.py(controller) at the root of the project.
