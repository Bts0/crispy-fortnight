#crispy-fortnight
Custom Python 2.7 RAT built just for fun. The intent is to understand the "inner-workings" of RAT's and improve detection of malicious behavior. Features are added for purely educational learning, NOT for malicious activity! You are responsible for your own actions. 

# How to run the things
You should not run the library directly. Run the implant.py and controller.py at the root of the project. Or run the test bash script if you're on \*nix.

```bash
    $ run.sh
```
